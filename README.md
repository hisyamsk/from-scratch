# From Scratch Project

This project is a collection of data structures and system utilities made "from scratch"in C, without any external libraries or dependencies. Currently, I have done sub-projects as follows:

- [x] Memory Allocator
- [x] Hash Table
- [x] Unit Testing 

This project will be frequently updated as I intend to build more, current plans are:

- [] HTTP
- [] In-memory database
